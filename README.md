# HTML-Website Project

### This is a sample website I made using HTML only. There will be no user interaction involved on this website as there is no JavaScript implemented to the project. 
### I just wanted to showcase what a website could possibly look like without CSS and JavaScript. HTML is the core language and provides the very basic styling to the website however, you need to use CSS and JavaScript if you want to make a good and interactive website.
### For this particular project, I used the table element in HTML to make the website. Make sure to download all the files to your computer (images folder and index file) so that the images also load on the sample HTML website.
### Thank you for looking at my HTML project! :smiley::smiley:
